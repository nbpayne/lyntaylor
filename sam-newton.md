This portrait was shot in under 30 seconds... Sam literally jumped in front of the camera while I was shooting Carpenter Caswell. 

The thing I love about Sam is that he's just incredibly photogenic. His wide-eyed approach to life is what makes him a special human.

Have a look at his work here:

As the lyrics and the production of this song are so intimate, I really wanted the shots to be simple, stark, and sometimes unbearably close and personal like the viewer is invading Samâ€™s personal space.
