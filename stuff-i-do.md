Hi! You’re probably wanting to know a little bit more about me, and what makes me different to all those other photographers out there. The truth is that I know where you’re coming from. I’ve been in a band since 2006, and I’ve been a photographer since 2001 This is my passion. I’m so excited to be able to continue to grow and learn, and now extending my skills into music videos!

I’m not just an admirer of photography and great cinematography, I  breathe it. I’m not just a music appreciator, I live it. I’m inspired by photographers such as Annie Leibovitz, and musicians like Ryan Adams. I believe that art, music and imagery are intertwined to communicate to others an emotion... a message.

I approach each photography project as I would approach songwriting… striving to produce something fresh, something that will stand out.

Most importantly though, the imagery  must be consistent with the music of the artist I’m photographing.

Before anything else, listening to your music is one of the first steps in the process of creating your imagery. Then we talk about the vision you have for your music, and then vision for the branding to present your music to your prospective fans.
